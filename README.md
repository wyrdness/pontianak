## Overview

The pontianak (known as **kuntilanak** in Indonesia) is one of the most feared supernatural beings in Malay and Indonesian folklore. This vampire ghost originates from women who died during pregnancy, childbirth, or from stillbirth.

The pontianak appears as a **beautiful woman in white** with long black hair to lure victims, particularly men. Once close, she reveals her true **hideous form** and attacks with sharp, long fingernails, **ripping out internal organs** with her claws and drinking blood. Pontianak particularly target pregnant women and newborns.

She can be detected by the **scent of frangipani flowers** (strong when far away, faint when nearby—the reverse of normal) or the sound of a **baby crying**.

> ⚠️ **CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Pontianak beliefs are part of active Southeast Asian folk tradition and reflect cultural attitudes toward childbirth, death, and women's roles.
