      "full": "The pontianak (known as kuntilanak in Indonesia) is one of the most feared supernatural beings in Malay and Indonesian folklore. This vampire ghost originates from women who died during pregnancy, childbirth, or from stillbirth. The pontianak appears as a beautiful woman in white with long black hair to lure victims, particularly men. Once close, she reveals her true hideous form and attacks with sharp, long fingernails, ripping out internal organs with her claws and drinking blood. Pontianak particularly target pregnant women and can be detected by the scent of frangipani flowers (scent strong when far, faint when near) or the sound of a baby crying. Prevention methods include driving a nail into the hollow at the nape of her neck or placing glass beads in a corpse's mouth to prevent transformation. The pontianak has become a staple of Southeast Asian horror cinema and urban legends, and a city in Indonesia bears her name."
